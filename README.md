# facedetectdro

This project is about real time face recognition using  OpenCv and Haar cascade classifier whereby the camera feed is from the DJI Tello drone. You can download this repository or copy paste them into your script files. Once you have all the files included in your project file you can now run the facedetect.py file but remember to establish the Wifi connection of the Tello drone first.
